### htmli

HTML Injection (HTMLi) is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject HTML code into a web page by exploiting a weakness in the input validation process. This can happen, for example, if a web application does not properly validate user input or if it allows users to submit data that includes HTML tags that can be executed on the page.
